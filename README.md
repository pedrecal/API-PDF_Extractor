# PDF Extractor

This API was developed for [my](https://www.github.com/pedrecal) bachelor thesis in Computer Science by the [Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz](http://www.uesc.br).

The objective of this work is to extract data from pre-formatted PDF files.

The dissertation of this work can be found [here](https://github.com/pedrecal/PDFExtractor-TCC-TeX). (In brazilian portuguese)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Most important you will need [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) v12 or greater.

And [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

Then you will need an running instace of mongoDB, it can be [mLab](http://mlab.com/), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or a local version.

So you can configure the [variables.env.example](variables.env.example). Remember to remove the *.example* at the end of the file name.

### Installing

With all the prerequisites done, you need to install the dependencies

```
yarn
```

And to have the API up and running:

```
yarn run dev
```

This way you will have the development server running.
